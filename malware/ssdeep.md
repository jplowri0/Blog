# SSDeep
## About
- If the file is altered in someway. 
- Ofthen malware authors will slightly edit some bytes, data or one string to change the hash. This could be an attempt to avoid detection. 
- SSDeep breaks the files into small parts and computes the hashes of each section. It then matches each section 
- Comparing SSDEEP values can identify these tactics. It looks at the SSDEEP values and computes a likeness percentage 
- If we get a 90% similarity then we know its somewhat similar. 
- SSDeep tool is a CLI tool. See 29:30. We use -k flag to compare

## Tools
- Virus Total 
- CLI Tool - ssdeep - on remnux

## Process
### Obtaining Value
- On Virus Total we can get the SSDeep from Details Pane

### Comparing
- Best done on REMnux 
Need both samples. Give both samples the same starting file name such as IPCIC ..... Then comp both SSDEEP values (of each sample) and export to fuzzy.db
```
ssdeep IPCIC* > fuzzy.db
```

Now we do that comparison: 
```
ssdeep -s -a -m fuzzy.db IPCIC*
```
