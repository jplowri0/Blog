# Section Headers
## About 
- This part can help us understand if a file is packed or not. 
- if text / data not visible, then the sample may be packed. It could be trying to hide something
- text: Contains the executable code
- data: Global data is defined here / defined variables 
- rsrc: (resource) supporting files such as icons. Could contain other executables or dropping executables. 
- rloc: (relocation). From which address execution will start / pointer table

## Tools
- CFF Explorer
- PEview
- ResourceHacker

## Process
- CFF Explorer > Section Headers
- Can see the list of headers

![hey](https://github.com/jplowri0/Blog/blob/main/malware/sectionHeaders.png)

- If we cannot see .text or .data sections then we could believe this to be packed or trying to hide something 
- Can check sizes again. 
- For virtual size and raw sizes see [[File sizes]]
- Check ResourceHacker for a visual on resources used in the sample

## Notable
There is the presence of .ndata? This is an uncommon section name and should be treated as suspicious
